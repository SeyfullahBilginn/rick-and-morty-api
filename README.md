## Development Process

###  I tried to use functional components. I created file named "service" for fetching datas from rick and morty api. I want to collect states widely used (not only for only this project, but also for a large scale project) in contexts which are pagination context and layout context. I wanted to design an algorithm for different versions of pagination (left-aligned, middle aligned, right aligned) as seen below:
  
(rick and morty api doesn't have more than 7 pages. If it had more than 7 pages, it would look like this)

### I decided to display active page variable in url. For that reason, I used [url object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL) . Thus, users can send the link to share the page they monitor.
